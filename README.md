# lIkeMovie-Assignment

The assignment was to make a movie recommender such as the ome that netflix ran a competition for. The program had to read in from a file and be able to save that file as an xml file. It also had to be able to enter and save new data into that xml file. Such as new users or movies as well as search through that file using different types of data as its search key.
